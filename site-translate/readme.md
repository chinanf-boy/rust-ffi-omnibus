*The Rust FFI Omnibus* is a collection of examples of using code
written in [Rust] from other languages.

Rust has drawn a large number of people who are interested in calling
native code from higher-level languages. Many nearly duplicate
questions have been asked on [Stack Overflow][so], so the *Omnibus*
was created as a central location for easy reference.

Both this site and all the examples are kept in a
[GitHub repository][repo] and are tested for correctness. Check out
each example for complete, working code. Requests, suggestions, or
corrections can be [filed using Github Issues][issues].

Translations

The Omnibus is translated into different languages by volunteers,
thanks!
